Story time!

If you take pains to push back against irrational or impossible schedules, have a good relationship with your coworkers, 
have a comfortable life outside of work, enjoy what you're doing and have success with it, you may have a long career without burnout. 
I have worked with several old, happy developers.
I burned out hard on a job early in my career, maybe 3 years after graduating. 
The company doesnâ€™t exist anymore, and the managers who created the situation are apparently no longer managing. 
I was too green to know you can and should say 'no' sometimes. 
I was on a high-profile, high-dollar project that kept losing people (to burnout- big warning sign) and not replacing them, 
but management wouldn't change any of the schedule to account for fewer developers. The job paid overtime, 
so I guess the theory was we were getting paid well for our long hours, so we should be happy. 
A team of 7 full-time devs got whittled down to 3. 
I hardly remember a thing about the last 3 months- it was nonstop bug creation and bug fixing, never saw daylight, ate poorly and slept worse, 
all the while realizing management had screwed themselves promising deadlines to a much more powerful entity and were relying on us to pull a multi-month hail-mary to make it. 
I cracked under the pressure and left. I hear the program finally got cancelled shortly after. 
Fortunately I had earned lots of overtime, because I couldn't work (or even think straight) for 6 months after that ordeal.

However, after a 6 month break in which I traveled, slept, read for pleasure and not much else, I started interviewing again. 
I got a really fun job with some great people, and exercised a newfound respect for taking care of myself. 
I've been kicking ass and taking names ever since (15ish years and counting)

Make sure you take charge of the work you do. You own it, and it reflects on you. 
Demand the time and resources to do it well, then do it well. The success that follows will keep you sane and happy.

Most do not burn out. Instead, they are promoted to roles that involve less and less coding. 
For those of us that remain in or around coding, the formula for keeping it together is simple. 
Take care of oneself. Maintain the body. Feed the mind. Build strong and lasting emotional ties. Play, eat, sleep, and have fun.
